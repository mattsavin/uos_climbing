            <p>The University of Sheffield Climbing Club (USCC) is a brand new student sport club, officially launching
              next month. We were born out of a desire for greater autonomy and a specific vision for what a university
              climbing team should look like.</p>
            <p>Previously operating under the umbrella of the USMC (University of Sheffield Mountaineering Club), we
              realized that our core interests—primarily indoor climbing and high-level bouldering/lead
              competitions—required a dedicated structure. The USMC's broad scope didn't provide us with the focused
              autonomy we needed to support our growing competitive squad and our regular indoor climbing community.</p>
            <p>By declaring independence, we are now able to build a community perfectly tailored to modern gym climbers
              and competitive athletes, while remaining incredibly welcoming to completely new climbers looking to learn
              the ropes.</p>
